Next actions (Deadline on 24th of November):
============================================

* mathSAT proofs in VeriT's format (Feasible?) (Georg's Student)

* Introduction: separate contributions from state of the start and related work (Bruno)

* Introduction: story-line (Georg)

* clean code (Andreas)

* n. log(n^2) - Downey-Sehti. (Pascal)

* cite the reviewers (Pascal)

* find good journals where the paper could be submitted (Pascal and Georg)

* Setup access to Git repository (Pascal, Georg, Bruno)


Discussed on 29th of October, but action postponed:
===================================================

* Source for good benchmarks: Besson, PxTP 2012 http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Frederic.Besson/euf.pdf

* Testing compressibility by translating to SAT. Is it impractical as in Space compression?

* Maybe move the basic definitions etc. to a section "Preliminaries".

* Move basic proofs, definitions and pseudo-codes to appendix.

* Some proofs (which?) might need a little bit more detailed explanation. 

* The pseudo-code for some of the very simple methods can probably be 
removed. 

* Give more hints toward the intuition behind the more complex methods (which?)  
(troubles to "reverse-engineer" the intuitive meaning of some data structures.)
