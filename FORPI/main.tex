\maketitle


\begin{abstract}%TODO: this
This paper describes a generalization of the recently developed \RecyclePivotsIntersection algorithm applicable to first-order logic proofs generated by automated theorem provers. \RecyclePivotsIntersection removes inferences with a node $\eta$ when its pivot literal occurs as the pivot of another inference located below in the path from $\eta$ to the root of the proof. The algorithm is then combined with \SFOLowerUnits in order to compress first-order proofs further. A preliminary empirical evaluation of the combination of these compression algorithms is presented.

\section{Introduction}
%TODO: re-write 
Most of the effort in automated reasoning so far has been dedicated to the design and implementation of proof systems and efficient theorem proving procedures. As a result, saturation-based first-order automated theorem provers have achieved a high degree of maturity, with resolution and superposition being among the most common underlying proof calculi. Proof production is an essential feature of modern state-of-the-art provers and proofs are crucial for applications where the user requires certification of the answer provided by the prover. Nevertheless, efficient proof production is 
non-trivial,
%non-trivial \cite{SchultzAPPA}, 
and it is to be expected that the best, most efficient, provers do not necessarily generate the best, least redundant, proofs. Therefore, it is a timely moment to develop methods that post-process and simplify proofs. %While the foundational problem of simplicity of proofs can be traced back at least to Hilbert's 24th Problem, the maturity of automated deduction has made it particularly relevant today.  

For proofs generated by SAT- and SMT-solvers, which use propositional resolution as the basis for the DPLL and CDCL decision procedures, there is now a wide variety of proof compression techniques. Algebraic properties of the resolution
operation that might be useful for compression were investigated in \cite{bwp10}.
Compression algorithms based on rearranging and sharing chains of resolution inferences have been
developed in \cite{Amjad07} and \cite{Sinz}.  Cotton \cite{CottonSplit} proposed an algorithm that
compresses a refutation by repeteadly splitting it into a proof of a heuristically chosen literal $\ell$
and a proof of $\dual{\ell}$, and then resolving them to form a new refutation.  The {\ReduceReconstruct} algorithm \cite{RedRec} searches for locally redundant
subproofs that can be rewritten into subproofs of stronger clauses and with fewer resolution steps.
A linear time proof compression algorithm based on partial
regularization was proposed in \cite{RP08} and improved in \cite{LURPI}. Furthermore, \cite{LURPI} also described a new linear time algorithm called {\LowerUnits}, which delays resolution with unit clauses.

In contrast, for first-order theorem provers, there has been up to now (to the best of our knowledge) no attempt to design and implement an algorithm capable of taking a first-order resolution DAG-proof and efficiently simplifying it, outputting a possibly shorter pure first-order resolution DAG-proof. There are algorithms aimed at simplifying first-order sequent calculus tree-like proofs, based on cut-introduction \cite{BrunoLPAR,Hetzl}, and while in principle resolution DAG-proofs can be translated to sequent-calculus tree-like proofs (and then back), such translations lead to undesirable efficiency overheads. There is also an algorithm \cite{LPARCzech} that looks for terms that occur often in any TSTP \cite{TPTP} proof (including first-order resolution DAG-proofs) and introduces abbreviations for these terms. However, as the definitions of the abbreviations are not part of the output proof, it cannot be checked by a pure first-order resolution proof checker.

%TODO: edit this again
In this paper, we continue the process of lifting propositional proof compression techniques to the first-order case, by lifting the \RecyclePivotsIntersection algorithm. As shown in Section \ref{sec:Challenges}, the fact that first-order resolution makes use of unification leads to many challenges that simply do not exist in the propositional case. In Section \ref{sec:FORPI} we describe modifications necessary to overcome these challenges. In Section \ref{sec:exp} we present preliminary experimental results obtained by applying this algorithm along with {\SFOLowerUnits} on hundreds of proofs generated with the {\SPASS} theorem prover. 
%SPASS} theorem prover \cite{SPASS}. 
The next section introduces the first-order resolution calculus using notations that are more convenient for describing proof transformation operations.

%\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
%TODO: this section?
%{\FORPI} continues to support the idea of listing propositional proof compression algorithms to the first-order case. The experimental results discussed in the previous continue to be encouraging, and are consistent with trends observed in the propositional case.
