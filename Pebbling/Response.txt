We would like to thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback. 

We would like to emphasize that this is the first paper proposing, implementing and evaluating algorithms for compressing the *space* of *resolution* proofs in a *post-processing* phase (space should not be confused with size or length). Therefore, we think its originality is high. Moreover, SAT proofs can be long (see: http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25068#.UylM3FFdUmc) and checking them may require considerable space (see our reference 12). Therefore, we think the paper's relevance and significance to the SAT conference is high. 

We will implement all the reviewer's concrete suggestions for improving the presentation of the paper. The changes are numerous but easy to implement. We will start doing it this weekend (22nd and 23rd of march) and updated versions of the paper will be available in https://github.com/Paradoxika/Papers/tree/develop/Pebbling. 


Thus we hope the reviewers will lean towards acceptance. 

Here are details of the changes we will do: 

* we will invert the directions of edges (and update the parent/child terminology accordingly). 

* we will make the sentences in definitions 1 and 4 shorter, in order to make them easier to parse. 

* we will improve table 2, by removing unnecessary lines and emphasizing the best results. 

* we will avoid notation when unnecessary; use simpler and more mnemonic notation when necessary (e.g. "root" instead of "rho", "<" instead of "<_T",...) 

* we will remark in definition 1 that V_L and V_R are not necessarily disjoint 

*(Reviewer1) "...the description of the heuristic methods is not very detailed.": we believe the descriptions are mathematically precise and concise, thanks to a modular and generic description parameterized by a node evaluation function "e_h". This conciseness may give the impression that section 7 is too short and has little content. We have also briefly discussed the intuitive motivations for each heuristic. We would be grateful if you could clarify what kind of details you miss. Would you like more mathematical details? Or additional informal explanations about the heuristics? Or longer discussions about the intuitive motivations for each heuristic? 

*(Reviewer1) "Since most SAT-solvers are based on DPLL algorithms, the proof graph is [...] a tree": we are dealing with CDCL SAT- and SMT-solvers. Restarts and learned clauses result in possibly non-tree-like DAG proofs. We will clarify this in the paper. 

*(Reviewer1) "its only merit comes from the experimental part.": Although the experimental part is indeed the main focus of the paper, the theoretical description of greedy pebbling heuristics is new and has merits too. The proposed heuristics are simple, and we see simplicity as a theoretical advantage (which is corroborated by our experimental results). We will emphasize the theoretical merits of the heuristics (especially of bottom-up heuristics) more strongly in the conclusion of the paper. 

*(Reviewer2) "In Example 1/2, I am not sure how you are able to pebble this graph in three pebbles, or even four.": you are right. It is not possible to pebble it with three pebbles. Our mistake, when we produced the examples, was to consider a slightly different pebbling game that allows pebbles to be *moved*. Thanks for finding this mistake. The example has to be changed a bit to work without moving pebbles. However, the message will stay the same. We will also improve these examples by numbering all nodes and describing (in the text) a full pebbling strategy. 

*(Reviewer3) "...L appears out of nowhere": L is defined in the text one line above Definition 1. Maybe you overlooked this line? If not, please let us know. 
(Reviewer 3) "What exactly are the nodes a proof and what is the Gamma?": Definition 1 is intended to be mathematically precise, and we believe it is fulfilling its purpose. To answer your question, we will add a few sentences informally explaining what a proof is in the text just before definition 1. 

*(Reviewer3) "Definition 2 is ok, but rather informal": We followed the style of most literature on pebbling games, but we agree: it is informal. We will make it formal by first defining a sequence of pebbling and unpebbling moves, and then stating the rules of the pebbling game as conditions that must be satisfied by such sequences. Also Definition 4 will benefit from the restructuring/formalization of Definition 2. 

*(Reviewer3) "what is O(m), Omega(m!)?" : O and Omega are the standard big-O notations used in computational complexity. We believe these notations are sufficiently widespread and well-known that they do not need to be defined in this paper. 

* (Reviewer3) "what is the message of Theorem 2?": it is stated in the paragraph just above the theorem. 

* (Reviewer3) "absolute performance for the individual sets would be more clear": the difficulty is that there is no absolute scale, since space is a function of the proof *and* a topological order for the nodes of the proof, and the input proof does not come with a pre-defined topological order. That's why we decided to compare with the average. Maybe you could tell us what exactly you have in mind when you request absolute performance? 

*(Reviewer3) "Even if this approaches work in a different way then the proposed pebbling approach some discussion emphasizing the differences would strengthen the contribution of this paper": Yes, all previous work (including ours) was focused on compressing length/size. This is the first paper for compressing space. Following your request, we will add a brief discussion about this in the introduction. 

*(Reviewer3) "Further, [1] should be included in related work explicitly": Yes. Definitely. Thank you. We will add it. 

*(Reviewer4) "there are close connections to the space complexity of resolution, 
and thus an overview is needed, with a discussion of the connections. There 
are some comments, but they are only of a technical nature": our comments in section 4 aim at covering the conceptual connections between pebbling and proof space. In case you consider that we are missing something there, could you please point it out for us? 

* (Reviewer4) "intuitively, one expects the task of space compression at least as hard as proof checking?": yes, from a theoretical complexity point of view, one could argue it is harder. Proof-checking is polynomial in the size of the proof, while deciding whether it is possible to check a proof with less than N pebbles is NP-complete (as indicated in page 3). We will add a sentence explaining this in section 4. 

*(Reviewer4) we will solve ambiguous anaphoric references caused by the use of the demonstrative pronoun "this". 

*(Reviewer4) "For Theorem 1 you only provide a sketch": the sketchiness of the proof is a consequence of the informality of definition 2 (which is something we inherited from the literature on pebbling games). With greater formality in definition 2, as indicated above, greater precision in the proof of theorem 1 will follow. 

*(Reviewer4) "Def. 5 doesn't discuss at all the literature!": is there any particular paper that you would suggest us to cite/discuss? 

*(Reviewer4) "what does 'remove pebbles if *possible*' mean?": we will replace this unclear sentence by 'remove a pebble p if all children of p have already been pebbled'. 

Thanks for your time and for your feedback!
