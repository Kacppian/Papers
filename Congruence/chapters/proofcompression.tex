Proofs are the central object of this work.
In this chapter we define the resolution calculus, which is extended to reason about equality in Section \ref{sec:calculus}.
We define what a proof in this calculus is, measures of proofs and what it means to process a proof.
Our method is stated so it compresses resolution proofs.
However, the method is in its core independent of the underlying proof system.
As long as a proof system is able to express congruence reasoning in a systematic way, we can easily adapt our compression algorithm to that system.
