In this chapter we present a method to compress proofs in length.
The method manipulates SMT proofs of the theory of equality.
To this end, in Section \ref{sec:calculus} we extend the resolution calculus presented in 
Section \ref{sec:resolution} to handle equality and its axioms.
The proof compression method is based on the idea of replacing long explanations for the equality of two terms by shorter ones.
In Section \ref{sec:npcomplete} we show that finding the shortest explanation is NP-complete.
In Section \ref{sec:algorithm} we present our explanation producing congruence closure algorithm, which is applied in the proof compression algorithm presented in Section \ref{sec:proofproduction}.
Closing this chapter, we give an outlook of possible future work.
