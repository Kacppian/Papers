\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Several algorithms for compressing proofs with respect to space have been conceived. The experimental evaluation clearly shows that the so-called Bottom-Up algorithms are faster and compress more than the more natural, straightforward and simple Top-Down algorithms. Both kinds of algorithms are parameterized by a heuristic function for selecting nodes. The best performances are achieved with the simplest heuristics (i.e. Last Child and Number of Children). More sophisticated heuristics provided little extra compression but cost a high price in execution time. Future work could investigate heuristics that take advantage of the particular shape of proofs generated by analysis of conflict graphs.
