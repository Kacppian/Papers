%%150-250 words
This paper describes algorithms and heuristics for playing a \emph{Pebbling Game}. Playing the game with a small number of pebbles is analogous to processing a proof with a small amount of available memory. Here this analogy is exploited: new pebbling algorithms are conceived and evaluated on the task of compressing the space of thousands of propositional resolution proofs generated by SAT- and SMT-solvers.
